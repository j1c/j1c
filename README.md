I am fourth-year a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. My research is in the [NeuroData lab](https://neurodata.io) where I am advised by Dr. Joshua T. Vogelstein. 

My work focuses on using statistical and computational techniques to help understand populations of macroscale connectomes. Currently, I am collaborating with Microsoft Research on the development of [graspologic](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic), a Python package for statistical analyses of networks.
